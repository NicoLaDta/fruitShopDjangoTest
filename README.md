# test_mediatree

## Versions
- Python 3.8.5
- Django 2.2

### Synopsis:

Fruit shop needs a platform to manage their products and sells.
This platform should contain a place to manage products another one for sells and should require a login to use it.

Requirements:

- django admin resources are not allowed
- virtualenv
- python3.6
- django1.11 or django2
- Pages (as templates):
** login
** CRUD for products
** CRUD for sells
** must exist a logout button somewhere
- all views should be documented (docstrings even if autogenerated)
- at least three apps (products, sells, users)
- mandatory to use javascript or jquery
- all CRUDs should be handled through an API (can be in the apps or have a app just for that) [if possible do not use Django Rest Framework]
- all create and update and delete calls should be executed through javascript (ajax ...) [not mandatory but a plus]
- unit/functional tests for each app (can be something simple like call an API and check response status) [not mandatory but a plus]
- the project should have a normal folder structure (docs, src, tests, requirments.txt)
- documentation is mandatory (even if short) and should at least contain information on how to run project and tests
- it can be delivered via git
